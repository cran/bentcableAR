Description: 
	Included are two main interfaces for fitting and diagnosing
	bent-cable regressions for autoregressive time-series data or
	independent data (time series or otherwise): 'bentcable.ar()' and
	'bentcable.dev.plot()'. Some components in the package can also be
	used as stand-alone functions. The bent cable
	(linear-quadratic-linear) generalizes the broken stick
	(linear-linear), which is also handled by this package. Version 0.2
	corrects a glitch in the computation of confidence intervals for the
	CTP. References that were updated from Versions 0.2.1 and 0.2.2 appear
	in Version 0.2.3 and up. Version 0.3.0 improves robustness of the
	error-message producing mechanism. It is the author's intention to
	distribute any future updates via GitHub.
